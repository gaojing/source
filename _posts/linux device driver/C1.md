# An Introduction to Device Drivers 
## The Role of the Device Driver
Device driver的目标是提供mechanism, 不是policy. 

- mechanism   
what capabilities are to be provided
- policy   
how those capabilities can be used

## Splitting the Kernel
- Process management
- Memory management
- Filesystems
- Device control
- Networking

## Loadable Modules
Each piece of code that can be added to the kernel at runtime is called a module.

## Classes of Devices and Modules
三种基本设备类型

- char devices   
以字节流的方式访问。通常实现open,close,read,write系统调用。
- block devices   
block device可以运行filesystem，通常IO操作以块的方式传输数据。
- network interfaces

## Security Issues
